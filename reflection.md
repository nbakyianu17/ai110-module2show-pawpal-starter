# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

The three core actions a user should be able to perform:

1. **Register a pet and owner** — The user enters basic information about themselves (name, available time per day) and their pet (name, species). This gives the scheduler the context it needs to personalize the plan and respect time constraints.

2. **Add and manage care tasks** — The user defines what needs to happen each day: task name, how long it takes (in minutes), and how important it is (priority: low / medium / high). Tasks can be added before generating a schedule so the system has a complete picture of the day's needs.

3. **Generate and view today's schedule** — The user triggers the scheduler, which selects and orders tasks based on priority and time available, then displays the resulting plan along with a brief explanation of why each task was included and when it is scheduled.

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
